# **Introduction**

This is a collection of methods to let tour TELLO EDU to execute a series of designed actions including using additional third-party software, running Python-based sample code and using Swift Playground.

Establish Connection 
Firstly, TELLO EDU need to be connected with a laptop or other related devices. You can control TELLO EDU with text commands once the TELLO SDK connects to your aircraft through a WiFi UDP port. You may install additional third-party software or use Python-based code to establish a connection between TELLO and PC, MAC, or mobile devices.

Connection Configuration
TELLO IP: 192.168.10.1
UDP Port: 8889
*Send “command” to TELLO EDU via UDP port 8889 to initiate SDK mode after set up a UDP client on the PC, MAC, or mobile device.
