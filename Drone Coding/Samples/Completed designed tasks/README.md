# Completed designed tasks

## Overview
Using the foundation framework with open language to complete designed tasks and challenges. The foundation framework provides a base layer of functionality for apps and frameworks, including data storage and persistence, text processing, data and time calculations, sorting and filtering, and networking. The classes, protocols, and data types defined by foundation are used throughout the masOS, iOS and etc.

Swift includes modern features like type inference, optional, and closures, which make the syntax concise yet expressive. Swift ensures your code is fast and efficient, while its memory safety and native error handing make the language safe by design. Writing Swift code is interactive and fun in Swift Playgrounds, playgrounds in Xcode, and REPL.

To solve complex problems and write high-performance, readable code, you may use standard library. The Swift standard library defines a base layer of functionality for writing Swift programs, including:

⋅⋅*	Fundamental data types such as Int, Double, and String
⋅⋅*	Common data structures such as Array, Dictionary, and Set
⋅⋅*	Global functions such as print(_:separator:terminator:) and abs(_:)
⋅⋅* Protocols, such as Collection and Equatable, that describe common abstractions.
⋅⋅*	Protocols, such as CustomDebugStringConvertible and CustomReflectable, that you use to customize operations that are available to all types.
⋅⋅*	Protocols, such as OptionSet, that you use to provide implementations that would otherwise require boilerplate code.

### Explore the Standard Library
Experiment with Swift standard library types and learn high-level concepts using visualizations and practical examples. Learn how the Swift standard library uses protocols and generics to express powerful constraints. Download the playground below to get started.
